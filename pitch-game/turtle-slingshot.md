Are you hungry for pecan turtles? Of course you are! All good-hearted people are. (Unless you have nut allergy.)

Are you afraid that you will eat all your pecan turtles too fast and end up sluggish with low blood-sugar?

Fear not!

With our new turtle slingshot, an actual turtle will load a pecan turtle into your slingshot. They will fire the pecan turtle into your mouth. You will get a delicious treat, but only one every half hour--because turtles are slow!

Delicious! Yet moderation! Everyone wins! Call now!

Pecan turtles for your face! With the turtle slingshot!
